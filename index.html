                        <p> An American singer-songwriter, artist and writer. He has been influential in popular  music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “The Times They Are a-Changin’” became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. </p>
                        <p>Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award and has also been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was awarded a The Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for “his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.”</p>

The group later had a number of soul hits and a No. 1 pop song with “Let’s Do It Again,” from the film soundtrack of the same name. Mavis has also established a solo career while working with a range of artists, from Prince to Natalie Merchant.</p>
